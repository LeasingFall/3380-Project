List all drivers involved in collisions who were also involved in traffic violations.
An analyst may want to know if drivers with more traffic violations get into more collisions.
QI SQL: Select distinct PID from Driver natural join TrafficVioIations natural join Collision;

What are the top [number] type of cars that most often get into collisions?
An analyst may want to know if there are characteristics of these cars, make, model, year,
etc., that appear frequently in car collisions. The analyst can specify the top number of car
types they want.
Q2 SQL: Select BodyType, Make, Model, Year from Vehicle natural join collisions Group By
BodyType, Make, Model, Year Order By count (CID) desc limit ?;

The user gets to pick which injury severity they want to get data from. Once they select
which injury severity, we list the top [number] type of collisions associated with that injury
severity. An analyst may want to know if people get injured more severely if they are rear
ended, t-boned or face a head on collision.
Q3 SQL: Select distinct CollisionType, injurySeverity from Collision join Driver on
Collision.PlD = Driver.PlD join RelatedWith on Collision.ClD = RelatedWith.ClD join
NonMotorist on RelatedWith. PID = NonMotorist.PlD where injurySeverity = ? Group By
injurySeverity, CollisionType Order By count(Collision.ClD) desc limit ?;

What were the top [number] non-motorist movements/actions (i.e: standing, walking etc.)
at the time of the collision? (non-motorist types: pedestrian, cyclist)
An analyst may want to know if the actions of the pedestrian/cyclist put themselves into
positions that cause collisions.
Q4 SQL: Select distinct actions, movement from Collision natural join RelatedWith natural
join NonMototrist Group By actions, movement Order By count(Collision.ClD) desc limit ?;

Find the number of collisions on each street (i.e. street name).
An analyst may want to know if a road gets more collisions on it than others.
Q5 SQL: Select roadName, count(Collision.ClD) as num from Collision natural join Location
Group By roadName Order By num desc;

How many collisions involve more than two cars.
An analyst may want to know that, if a collision occurs, is it likely that more than two cars
are involved? E.g. a chain of rear end collisions.
Q6 SQL: Select distinct reportNumber from Report naturaljoin Collision Group By
reportNumber Having count(distinct Collision.VI D) > 2;

How many collisions are there for each weather condition? An analyst may want to know
how the weather affects the number of collisions that occur.
Q7 SQL: Select distinct weather, count(Collision.ClD) from environmentalConditions
natural join has natural join Location natural join Collision Group By weather;

How many collisions are there for each lighting? An analyst may want to know how the
lighting affects the number of collisions that occur.
Q8 SQL: Select distinct light, count(Collision.ClD) from environmentalConditions natural
join has natural join Location natural join Collision Group By light;

How many collisions are there for each surface condition? An analyst may want to know
how the road surface condition affects the number of collisions that occur.
Q9 SQL: Select distinct surfaceCondition, count(Collision.ClD) from
environmentalConditions natural join Has natural join Location natural join Collision Group
By surfaceCondition;

User inputs speed limit (i.e: 70 mph). Then, we find all collisions associated with that speed
limit, and display collision type (i.e: rearend) and how many collisions there are for that type
and the provided speed limit.
An analyst wants to know the common collision type for that speed limit.
Q1O SQL: Select distinct collisionType, count(Collision.ClD) as num where speedLimit = ?
Group By collisionType Order By num desc;

User picks what lighting they want to filter by. Then, we show all driver distractions for that
lighting (i.e: dusk, daylight).
An analyst may want to know the most common driver distraction for that lighting.
Q11 SQL: select distractedBy from collisions natural join driver natural join location natural
join has natural join environmentalConditions where environmentalConditions.light = ?;

Number of collisions per month, for each month in a given [year].
An analyst may want to know if there is a pattern of when these collisions occur in the
year. They may want to ask, do certain seasons contain more collisions than other
seasons?
Q12 SQL: select month, count(collisionlD) as numCollisions from collisions grouped by
month Order by month having year = ?;

Collision reports for person [personName] between [date1] and [date2]. An analyst might
want to know how many collisions a person has been in a certain time period, last month
for example.
Q13 SQL: SELECT * from collision where pid = ? and crashDate between ? and ?;

Traffic Violations for person [personNameJ between [date1] and [date2J. An analyst might
want to know how many traffic violations a person has over a certain time period, last
month for example.
Q14 SQL: SELECT * from TrafficViolations where pid = ? and crashDate between ? and ?;
